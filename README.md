Sure! Here's the updated **Architectural Notes** section with Redux, thunk, and slices included:

---

## Architectural Notes

- **Next.js** framework for React-based SSR and routing.
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) manage component state and side effects.
- **Redux Toolkit** is used for global state management, organizing state into **slices**.
- **Redux Thunk** middleware handles asynchronous actions like API calls.
- Data fetching is done via API calls defined in the `actions.ts` module, dispatched through Redux async thunks.
- User answers and other UI state are managed locally in components, while tests, filters, pagination, and search states are managed globally in Redux slices.
- Authentication token (JWT) is stored in `localStorage` and sent in request headers.
- The frontend does not directly call any external APIs; all calls are proxied through your backend API.
